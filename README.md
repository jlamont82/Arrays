# Arrays
a console app designed to solve the following problem- 
Write a program which prompts the user to enter two positive integers, each with up to
50 digits, then subtracts the second number from the first number, and prints the answer.
You should use an array to store each of the integers, with one digit in each array element.

Each input should be in the normal format, e.g. something like:

Enter first integer:
239834095803945862440835983452184985298358

Enter second integer:
939542309853120721934217021372984729812

Similarly the output of the answer should be in the normal format, i.e. the format you
would expect to get from a calculator with a large enough display. So for the input above:
The difference is: 238894553494092741718901766430812000568546

or (if the answer is negative)

The difference is: -29837430045
